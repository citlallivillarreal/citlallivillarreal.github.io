    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <div class="bio-container">
    <p class="bio">
       I recently graduated from the University of California, Berkeley earning a degree in Data Science with a
       concentration in Business and Industrial Analytics. I am proficient in various programming languages: Python,
       CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Splunk, and SQL. With my internship at BART, as a Data Scientist/Engineer,
       and 4 years of work experience as an assistant manager, I inevitably developed high-technical and
       interpersonal skills. Working within these two disparate organizations has taught me the immense notion
       of discipline and teamwork needed to succeed in any task regardless of size or technicality. I aspire
       to enter the technological or entertainment industry (but not limited to), as a Software or Data Engineer,
       in hopes of putting forth my technical (and non-technical) knowledge and drive to maximize not only company
       gain but reputability. I am a firm believer in maximizing the hybrid’s, companies and customers, positive
       economic and societal impact. College is just the beginning of learning and so I am ambitious, driven, and
       disciplined to grow intellectually. I am an advocate of being a long-life learner. Also, I am passionate about
       motivational speaking and inspiring others. I believe in the growth mindset, meaning “…(ones) talents and
       abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching, (discipline) and persistence.” (by Carol Dweck).
